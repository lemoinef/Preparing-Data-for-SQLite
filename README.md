# Project: Preparing Data For SQLite

We'll work with data on Academy Award nominations. The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an annual awards ceremony hosted to recognize the achievements in the film industry. There are many different awards categories and the members of the academy vote every year to decide which artist or film should get the award. The awards categories have changed over the years, and you can learn more about when categories were added on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards#Awards_of_Merit_categories).

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/download.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `preparing_data_for_sqlite.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Visualizing-Pixar-s-Roller-Coaster/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook preparing_data_for_sqlite.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook preparing_data_for_sqlite.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is included as `academy_awards.csv.csv`.
